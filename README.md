## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomilies, and sort out the same.
- Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

This project reflects my ability to turn raw data into strategic insights using modern BI tools. It's a practical demonstration of my analytical mindset and dashboard development skills.
